**IMPORTANT!!!** Default build adds incorrect path to assets (`/`) so I fixed the dist files and uploaded `dist/` folder.
For the purpose of the **assessment**, you can directly open `index.html` without building. Using `yarn build` will add the wrong paths again.

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn build
```
